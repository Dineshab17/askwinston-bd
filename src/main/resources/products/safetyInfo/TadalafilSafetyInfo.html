<h2>USES</h2>
<p>Tadalafil is the active ingredient in Cialis and therefore the generic version of Cialis. It is used to help manage and treat sexual dysfunction, specifically erectile dysfunction.

<p>Tadalafil is also available to treat high blood pressure a condition known as pulmonary hypertension as well as symptoms caused by an enlarged prostate known as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Do not take this medication if you are taking any other medications for erectile dysfunction or pulmonary hypertension including drugs belonging to the same class/group as sildenafil (i.e. Tadalafil, Vardenafil).</p>

<p>To treat erectile dysfunction, there are 2 ways that tadalafil may be prescribed and this may often be based on your frequency of sexual activity. If you are taking Tadalafil on an as needed basis you will likely be prescribed the 20 mg pill to be taken every 36 hours as needed, usually at least 30 minutes before sexual activity. Tadalafil's effect on sexual ability may last up to 36 hours. The second way to treat ED is to take Tadalafil regularly, once a day every day with a 5 mg once daily pill.
